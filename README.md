# 2D-Platformer-Player-Controller

Hi! Here you can use my 2d platformer player controller for free! I haven't optimized it yet so the code is still pretty messy but feel free to use it if you'd like!

It supports Coyote time, Jump buffering, Halved gravity jump peak, and Jump corner correction.

Written for the Unity Engine.
